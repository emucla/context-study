#read in the data

# exclude rows in which rows look like this: columns 8-15 are coded as 0 AND 16 is coded as 1 

pitch <- pitch_org[!(!apply(pitch_org[,8:15], 1,any) & pitch_org[,16] == 1),]

#renaming speech column to addressee

###Hypothesis 1: Comfort IDS v other IDS contexts - linear mixed effects regression###

#subset data to get IDS speech utterances only 
IDScom <- subset(pitch, addressee == "CDS")

#run the linear mixed effects regression - MEAN PITCH
mpitch_comfort = lmer(log(m_pitch) ~ comfort + (1 | ID), data = IDScom)
summary(mpitch_comfort)

#create regression table
library(sjPlot)

tab_model(mpitch_comfort, show.re.var= TRUE, 
pred.labels =c("(Intercept)", "Comfort"),
dv.labels= "log(Mean Pitch)")

#run the linear mixed effects regression - PITCH VARIABILITY
sdpit_comfort = lmer(log(sd_pit) ~ comfort + (1 | ID), data = IDScom)
summary(sdpit_comfort)
#create regression table 
tab_model(sdpit_comfort, show.re.var= TRUE, 
          pred.labels =c("(Intercept)", "Comfort"),
          dv.labels= "Pitch Variability")


### Hypothesis 2: IDS v ADS inform utterances- linear mixed effects regression#### 
inform <- subset(pitch, inform =="1")

#linear mixed effects regression - MEAN PITCH
mpitch_inform = lmer(log(m_pitch) ~ addressee + (1 | ID), data = inform)
summary(mpitch_inform)

#create regression table 
tab_model(mpitch_inform, show.re.var= TRUE, 
          pred.labels =c("(Intercept)", "addressee"),

tab_model(sdpit_inform, show.re.var= TRUE, 
          pred.labels =c("(Intercept)", "addressee"),
          dv.labels= "Pitch Variablity")


###Hypothesis 3: Frequency of comfort utterances in IDS v ADS -mixed effects logistic regression###

#dummy code ADS and CDS 
library(plyr)
pitch$cds <- revalue(pitch$addressee, c("CDS"="1", "ADS"="0"))
addressee_com <- as.factor(pitch$cds)

#Logistic regression for comfort utterance frequency by addressee

addressee_comfort = glmer(comfort ~ pitch$cds + (1 | ID), data = pitch, family=binomial)
summary(addressee_comfort)
tab_model(addressee_comfort, show.re.var= TRUE, 
          pred.labels =c("(Intercept)", "Comfort"),
          dv.labels= "Comfort Utterances in IDS v ADS")
